## [D001]: Event-Driven Architecture Using Kafka
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to decouple services so they can evolve independently and avoid direct API dependencies. Must handle high-throughput, real-time event flow with reliable delivery. Support for replay and temporal debugging required.

**Alternatives:**
- Synchronous HTTP API calls between services - Simple but creates tight coupling
- RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus - Lighter weight but limited replay capabilities
- Direct database triggers or CDC - Low latency but difficult to scale and debug

**Decision:** Use Kafka as the backbone for event distribution.

**Rationale:** Kafka provides the durability, partitioning, and replay features essential for audit requirements. It's battle-tested for high-throughput scenarios and offers excellent ecosystem support.

**Consequences:** 
- Increased operational complexity but better scalability
- Learning curve for team but industry-standard skills
- Higher infrastructure costs but better business value

## [D002]: Immutable Event Store in PostgreSQL
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a reliable, queryable, and immutable store of all events for compliance, forensics, and system debugging.

**Alternatives:**
- MongoDB with flexible schema - Good for semi-structured data but weaker consistency guarantees
- Kafka log as source of truth - Excellent for streaming but not optimized for ad hoc queries
- Dedicated event store products (EventStore, etc.) - Purpose-built but adds deployment complexity

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with an append-only table, leveraging JSONB for flexible event payloads.

**Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers mature reliability, excellent query performance, and strong consistency. JSONB provides schema flexibility while maintaining indexing capabilities.

**Consequences:**
- Strong consistency and query performance
- Familiar technology stack for team
- Storage growth over time requires partitioning strategy

## [D003]: Append-Only, Immutable Event Storage
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Compliance and traceability require that events can never be altered or deleted after creation.

**Alternatives:**
- Allow event updates with audit columns - Easier for corrections but compromises immutability
- Soft deletes with deleted flag - Maintains data but violates true immutability
- Hard delete old events - Saves storage but loses audit trail

**Decision:** Strict append-only, no updates or deletes permitted.

**Rationale:** True immutability is essential for legal/compliance requirements and debugging trust. Event sourcing patterns require this guarantee.

**Consequences:**
- Unquestionable audit trail integrity
- Storage growth requires archiving strategy
- Corrections require compensating events

## [D004]: REST API for Event Querying
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need accessible interface for internal tools, compliance officers, and engineers to query event history.

**Alternatives:**
- GraphQL API - More flexible querying but higher complexity
- gRPC API - Better performance but less ecosystem support
- Direct database access - Fastest but no security/abstraction layer

**Decision:** REST API with comprehensive filtering and Swagger documentation.

**Rationale:** REST is universally understood, easily consumable by diverse tools, and provides natural security boundaries.

**Consequences:**
- Wide compatibility with existing tools
- Clear security and access control boundaries
- Less flexible than GraphQL for complex queries

---

## [D005]: Field-Level Encryption for Sensitive Data
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Events may contain PII or sensitive business data requiring protection.

**Alternatives:**
- Store everything in plaintext - Simplest but high compliance risk
- Encrypt entire event payloads - Secure but makes querying difficult
- Use database-level encryption - Transparent but all-or-nothing approach

**Decision:** Encrypt only sensitive fields in payload using envelope encryption.

**Rationale:** Balances security with usability. Non-sensitive fields remain queryable while sensitive data is protected.

**Consequences:**
- Granular security control
- Encrypted fields not directly queryable
- Key management complexity

## [D006]: .NET 8 for Service Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to choose implementation technology for microservices with strong ecosystem support.

**Alternatives:**
- Java with Spring Boot - Mature ecosystem but heavier runtime
- Node.js - Lightweight but less structured for enterprise apps
- Go - Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem for business apps

**Decision:** .NET 8 with minimal APIs and hosted services.

**Rationale:** Modern .NET offers excellent performance, rich ecosystem, and strong typing. Team familiarity and Microsoft's cloud integration are advantages.

**Consequences:**
- Strong type safety and tooling
- Excellent cloud ecosystem integration
- Windows licensing considerations for hosting

## [D007]: Docker Containerization with Multi-Stage Builds
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need consistent deployment across environments with minimal resource usage.

**Alternatives:**
- Traditional server deployment - Simple but environment inconsistency
- Single-stage Docker builds - Easy but larger image sizes
- VM-based deployment - Isolated but resource-heavy

**Decision:** Multi-stage Docker builds with distroless base images.

**Rationale:** Optimizes for security (minimal attack surface) and efficiency (smaller images) while maintaining consistency.

**Consequences:**
- Faster deployments and better security
- Consistent environments across dev/prod
- Slightly more complex build process

## [D008]: Kubernetes for Container Orchestration
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need orchestration for microservices with scaling, health checks, and service discovery.

**Alternatives:**
- Docker Swarm - Simpler but less feature-rich
- Nomad - Lightweight but smaller ecosystem
- Managed container services - Less control but easier operations

**Decision:** Kubernetes with Helm charts for deployment.

**Rationale:** Industry standard with rich ecosystem. Provides all required features for enterprise deployment.

**Consequences:**
- Powerful orchestration capabilities
- Steep learning curve
- Complex but comprehensive solution

---

## [D009]: Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure provisioning.

**Alternatives:**
- AWS CloudFormation - Native but AWS-specific
- Pulumi - More programming language native but less mature
- Manual provisioning - Flexible but error-prone

**Decision:** Terraform with remote state management.

**Rationale:** Cloud-agnostic, mature tooling, and excellent provider ecosystem. Declarative approach fits infrastructure needs.

**Consequences:**
- Consistent, reproducible infrastructure
- Version control for infrastructure changes
- Learning curve for team

---

## [D010]: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need automated build, test, and deployment pipeline.

**Alternatives:**
- Jenkins - Flexible but requires maintenance
- Azure DevOps - Microsoft native but more complex
- GitLab CI - Integrated but requires GitLab

**Decision:** GitHub Actions with reusable workflows.

**Rationale:** Native GitHub integration, excellent .NET support, and cost-effective for the project size.

**Consequences:**
- Seamless repository integration
- Rich marketplace of actions
- Vendor lock-in to GitHub ecosystem
